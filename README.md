# Raylib Game

## Project Phases

### Phase 1
- Raylib window setup
- Top-down 2D map rendering
- Player movement with collision detection
- Basic minimap visualization
- Branch: phase-1

### Phase 2
- Raycasting engine implementation (2.5D rendering)
- Conversion of the 2D grid map into a 3D first-person view
- Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for precise ray traversal
- Wall height calculation based on perpendicular distance (fish-eye correction)
- Horizontal and vertical wall shading to enhance depth perception
- Stable rendering at 60 FPS
- Branch: phase-2

### Phase 3
- View mode toggling between Play Mode (3D) and Edit Mode (2D) using keyboard input
- Interactive map editor enabled in Edit Mode
- Mouse-based wall placement and removal on the grid
- Binary save and load system for persistent map storage
- Ability to design a map, save it, close the program, and reload it later
- Integration of all phases into a final playable build
- Branch: phase-3

Each phase is developed in a separate Git branch and merged into the `main` branch upon completion.  
Commit history reflects the incremental development process and key milestones of each phase.
